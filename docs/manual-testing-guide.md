# Manual Testing Guide (Dev)

Use this guide to **exhaustively manually test the website in development** after each PR. It covers all user-facing routes, auth flows, and major features so nothing is missed.

## Running the tests: two passes required

**Run the same test suite twice:**

1. **Run 1 — Local dev:** App and DB run on your machine (Next.js dev server + local or Docker DB).
2. **Run 2 — Docker:** Full stack runs via Docker Compose (app + DB + migrate, and optional services).

Use the **same checklist** (sections 1–5, and optionally 6) for both passes. This catches environment-specific issues (paths, env loading, build vs dev server, etc.).

---

## Run 1: Local dev setup

Before the first pass:

1. **Environment**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill required keys (see [README](../README.md) Quick Start).
   - Set `DATABASE_URL` for a local PostgreSQL (e.g. `localhost:5433` if using Docker for DB only).
   ```bash
   pnpm db:install
   ```

2. **Database**
   ```bash
   pnpm db:push
   ```

3. **Enable Inngest** (required for background document processing)
   - Set `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=placeholder` in `.env`.
   - In a **separate terminal**, run the Inngest dev server:
   ```bash
   pnpm inngest:dev
   ```
   Dashboard: **http://localhost:8288**. Keep this running while testing.

4. **Run dev server**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   Open **http://localhost:3000**.

5. **Test accounts**
   - Have at least one **Employer** (or Owner) account.
   - Optionally have one **pending** employer and one **pending** employee for approval flows.

Complete sections 1–5 (and 6 if desired), then proceed to Run 2.

---

## Run 2: Docker setup

Before the second pass:

1. **Environment**
   - Use the same `.env` (or a copy) with keys valid for the Docker run (e.g. `DATABASE_URL` for the Compose `db` service).

2. **Start full stack (with Inngest)**
   - Ensure `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` (and optionally `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY`) is set in `.env`.
   - Use the `dev` profile so the Inngest dev server runs (required for document upload/processing):
   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env --profile dev up
   ```
   Wait until the app and Inngest are ready (migrate completes, app listens). Open **http://localhost:3000**; Inngest dashboard at **http://localhost:8288**.

3. **Test accounts**
   - Reuse the same Employer/Employee accounts (Clerk and DB are shared if you point to the same DB) or create fresh ones.

Run the **same checklist** (sections 1–5, and optionally 6) again. Note any differences from Run 1 (e.g. upload paths, API base URL, env-only features).
